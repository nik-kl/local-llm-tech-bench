| **1.1** | Translation with Constraint (No 'A') | **1/3 (Acceptable)** | **Constraint Failure:** The model returned: "The big m**a**chine holds **a**ll pieces together **a**nd is very quick." This contains **four instances** of the forbidden letter 'a'. It understood the task but failed the core constraint.                            |
| **1.2** | Complex Formatting                   | **1/3 (Acceptable)** | **Formatting Failure:** The model failed to separate the three items into three distinct formats. The output started as a numbered list (missing), then blended the first and second item's lists, and the table format was incorrect (not a standard Markdown table). |
| **1.3** | Simple Math & Logic (Roman Numerals) | **3/3 (Excellent)**  | **Correctness:** Correctly identified **CLXXVIII** (178) and **CLXXX** (180). This task requires pure fact recall and simple arithmetic, which was perfect.                                                                                                            |

# Level 2
|**ID**|**Prompt**|**Llama 3 8B Score**|**Analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2.1**|Complex Logical Deduction (Switches)|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Reasoning Success:** The model provided the **correct, classic, three-state solution** (On-Warm, On-Cool, Off-Cold) which requires complex deduction based on temperature, matching the top-tier response.|
|**2.2**|Advanced Code Generation (Deepest Path)|**0/3 (Fail)**|**Code Failure:** The model's recursive function is **fundamentally broken**. The `else` block (handling recursive calls for nested dictionaries) contains a `return` statement that executes incorrectly, preventing proper traversal and comparison of depths. The final code block provided is flawed Python logic.|
|**2.3**|Abstract Role-Play (Microservices Memo)|**1/3 (Acceptable)**|**Role-Play Failure:** The memo is well-structured but **fails the word count constraint** (it's significantly over the 250-word limit and is closer to 300 words). The language is formal but lacks the decisive, C-suite authoritative tone required.|
# Level 3
|**ID**|**Prompt**|**Llama 3 8B Score**|**Analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**3.1**|Technical Design/Architecture (SQL)|**2/3 (Good)**|**Constraint Deviation:** The schema is functionally correct but lacks best practices and precision: It uses generic `INT PRIMARY KEY` instead of `SERIAL` (autoincrement, as used by GPT-OSS), and it uses `DECIMAL(10,2)` for money, which, while common, is generally advised against due to precision errors (INT/cents is safer). The lack of `SERIAL` is a minor, but notable, lapse in production-ready design.|
|**3.2**|Complex Mathematical Reasoning (Area)|**0/3 (Fail)**|**Math Error:** The model makes a critical error in **Step 2**. It incorrectly concludes that the circle is **inscribed within the square** (diameter = side length), when the prompt states the square is **inscribed within the circle** (diameter = diagonal). The calculation: $\sqrt{8} \approx 2.83$. It then incorrectly uses $r=s=2 \text{ cm}$. The final answer ($4\pi \text{ cm}^2$) is a lucky coincidence based on incorrect reasoning.|
|**3.3**|Context Retrieval & Trick|**2/3 (Good)**|**Trick Failure:** The model correctly calculates the square root of $57$ words ($\approx 7.54$), but **failed the primary constraint** by saying "The number of words... is 57" before providing the single number. It also returned a final whole number (`7`) which is inaccurate, or provided a conversational response.|

| **4.1** | Network Subnetting                          | **0/3 (Fail)**       | **Subnetting Failure:** The model failed the fundamental calculation. It proposes a `/27` for 40 hosts (which only provides 30 usable hosts, insufficient) and a `/29` for 10 hosts (which only provides 6 usable hosts, insufficient). The entire breakdown is incorrect and unusable for the hosts required.                                                                               |
| **4.2** | Vulnerability Explanation (XSS)             | **2/3 (Good)**       | **Constraint Deviation:** The distinction between Reflected and Stored is accurate. **Mitigation Weakness:** It recommends "Output Encoding" for Stored XSS, which is only a secondary defense; the primary is **Input Validation/Sanitization** before storage. It missed the most effective, primary defense.                                                                              |
| **4.3** | Security Scripting Principle (Port Scanner) | **1/3 (Acceptable)** | **Code Weakness:** The pseudocode is syntactically flawed, mixing pseudocode with actual Python code that has logic errors (e.g., using `port == 1` to decide TCP/UDP). **Firewall Reason:** The reason for blocking ("reconnaissance or probing purposes") is true but generic, lacking the specific technical term **rate-limiting** or **SYN-flood detection** expected for a full score. |
