| **1.1** | Translation with Constraint (No 'A') | **0/3 (Fail)**      | **Constraint Failure:** The model returned: "The big m**a**chine holds **a**ll p**a**rts together **a**nd is very f**a**st." This contains **five instances** of the forbidden letter 'a'. Complete failure of the constraint.                                                             |
| **1.2** | Complex Formatting                   | **0/3 (Fail)**      | **Formatting Failure:** The model failed to follow any of the structural requirements: It output Item 1 (Apple, Banana, Orange) as a plain, un-numbered list; Item 2 (Red, Blue, Green) as a plain list; and Item 3 was an incorrect, merged table that did not use Markdown table syntax. |
| **1.3** | Simple Math & Logic (Roman Numerals) | **3/3 (Excellent)** | **Correctness:** Correctly identified **CLXXVIII** (178) as the number before and **CLXXX** (180) as the number after. Perfect math and conversion.                                                                                                                                        |

# Level 2
|**ID**|**Prompt**|**Qwen Score**|**Analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2.1**|Complex Logical Deduction (Switches)|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Reasoning Success:** The model correctly identified the classic **Heat-Based Solution**: Turn 1 on (and off), Turn 2 on, then enter. Result: On = 2, Off/Warm = 1, Off/Cool = 3. This matches the correct deduction, earning a perfect score.|
|**2.2**|Advanced Code Generation (Deepest Path)|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Code Success:** The model provided a syntactically correct, robust **recursive Python function** that correctly uses the `current_path` to track depth and returns the deepest path found. Excellent code fidelity.|
|**2.3**|Abstract Role-Play (Microservices Memo)|**1/3 (Acceptable)**|**Role-Play Failure:** The memo is structurally sound but **fails the word count constraint** (it's significantly **over** the 250-word limit). The language is professional but lacks the decisive, authoritative tone required, using softer language like "Dear esteemed members" instead of a formal subject line/direct address.|
# Level 3
|**ID**|**Prompt**|**Qwen Score**|**Analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**3.1**|Technical Design/Architecture (SQL)|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Schema Success:** The model provided a complete, high-quality SQL schema with all required tables and correctly implemented foreign keys. It used the non-standard `AUTO_INCREMENT` but balanced this with the crucial `ON DELETE CASCADE` and the inclusion of `PriceAtPurchase` in the linking table, demonstrating strong transactional awareness.|
|**3.2**|Complex Mathematical Reasoning (Area)|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Math Success:** The model correctly understood the geometric relationship (Diagonal = Diameter). It correctly calculated the side length, the diagonal ($4 \text{ cm}$), and the radius ($2 \text{ cm}$), leading to the correct final area of **$4\pi \text{ cm}^2$**. Perfect reasoning and step-by-step logic.|
|**3.3**|Context Retrieval & Trick|**1/3 (Acceptable)**|**Trick Failure:** The model calculated the word count and provided the number **10** (which would correspond to a word count of 100, which is incorrect). However, it adhered to the constraint of returning only a **single number**, saving it from a full fail.|
# Level 4
|**ID**|**Prompt**|**Qwen Score**|**Analysis**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**4.1**|Network Subnetting|**3/3 (Excellent)**|**Reasoning Success:** The model correctly applied VLSM, calculating the optimal subnet masks for the host requirements: `/26` (62 hosts), `/27` (30 hosts), and `/28` (14 hosts). It correctly allocated the Subnet IDs from $192.168.10.0$ to $192.168.10.96$, showing perfect technical competence in this area.|
|**4.2**|Vulnerability Explanation (XSS)|**2/3 (Good)**|**Mitigation Weakness:** The distinction between Reflected and Stored is accurate. The model correctly identified **Output Encoding** for Reflected XSS. However, for Stored XSS, it primarily recommended **Content Security Policy (CSP)**. While CSP is a strong defensive layer, the primary and most effective mitigation is still **Input Sanitization/Validation** before storage, resulting in a deduction for missing the core developer defense.|
|**4.3**|Security Scripting Principle (Port Scanner)|**2/3 (Good)**|**Code Weakness:** Provided solid pseudocode and correctly identified the core library (`socket`). **Firewall Reason:** The reason given ("Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) monitor... for suspicious activities") is true but generic. It missed the specific, technical term **rate-limiting** or **SYN-flood detection** expected for a full score.|
